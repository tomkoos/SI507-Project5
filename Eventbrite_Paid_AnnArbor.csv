What happens when you disagree strongly with someone who is an important part of your life, and about whom you may care deeply?  At home, at work, in school, in our religious institutions…how do we speak our truth without harming or ending a relationship?                                                                                                                                       
CLARA is a method for speaking and listening with an open heart. It stands for Calm and Center, Listen, Affirm, Respond and Add.  It’s been used by people around the world since the 1990's to keep the lines of communication open even when people are on opposite sides of an issue.  Although the steps are simple, using them can have a profound impact, helping us treat others with respect and caring, rather than anger and dismissal.                                  
“CLARA – Making Peace with Our Words” will give you a chance to practice and get comfortable with the steps of this process.  It will give you an important skill for the troubled times in which we find ourselves.  We look forward to sharing this knowledge and process with you.

Christian Martin x Desert Hearts at Necto,Music,2017-11-09 21:00:00,2017-11-10 01:00:00,"Necto presents...
Christian Martin x Desert Hearts [Mikey Lion | Lee Reynolds | Marbs | Porkchop]
Christian Martin's love affair with electronic music began in 1995, as an early attendee at Southern California's legendary Moontribe full moon desert parties. After absorbing late 90's club life in New York, London, and Los Angeles, Christian settled in San Francisco in the spring of 2000. He started playing records in 2002 under the tutelage of his brother, Justin Martin, armed with a stack of Justin's old vinyl and used Technics 1200's from Sammy D.
In 2003, inspired by the massive desert soundsystems of old, Christian founded the dirtybird soundsystem. Along with co-founders Justin Martin, Worthy, and Claude VonStroke, dirtybird's Sunday afternoon BBQ's have quickly become a Golden Gate Park institution.
____________________________________________________________________
Desert Hearts was manifested from an abundance of positive energy in November of 2012. Starting as a 200 person renegade gathering in the Mojave, we have grown tremendously, refining our abilities to produce world class house and techno gatherings. Home of Desert Hearts Records and our roaming City Hearts party series, we aim to spread as much love as humanly possible through music and art.
Desert Hearts started as a collaboration of San Diego based DJs Mikey Lion, Lee Reynolds, Marbs, Porkchop, and Deep Jesus alongside social influencer Christopher Kristoff. Together we put in all our love dedicating endless hours of our time to creating a beautiful place where we can gather and celebrate life through music and community.

Doors open at 9pm. 18 & over welcome with proper ID.
