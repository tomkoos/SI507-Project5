In Life.\r\nHi, I\u2019m Kate Gaffin. I\u2019m a lifelong entrepreneur and entrepreneurial energy is my absolute favorite kind. I created 'Connecting to Greatness' because I wanted to create a better, more rewarding and even fun networking experience. \u00a0And over the last couple of years, I've been invited to teach my style of Business Networking and 'Warm' Marketing to Diplomats at the British Consulate, Students and Alumni at Pace, Barnard and the Institute of Integrative Nutrition as well as to hundreds of Small Business Owners and Entrepreneurs in the NYC area.\r\n\u00a0\r\nTo read a story on Fox News about my brand of Networking and Business Building, please click below:\r\nhttp://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2010/07/04/networking-heart/\r\nConnecting to Greatness is a different kind of networking group. Instead of simply throwing people into a room with no focus or no common goal, we strive to enlighten professionals on how to network more effectively and build their business more authentically. We want our attendees walking away from our gatherings with insight on what to do with all the business cards they\u2019ve collected and how to cultivate powerful alliances with those they meet. And we want to give our attendees the insights to grow the kind of business success they\u2019ve always dreamed of.\r\nIn 2013, Connecting to Greatness will host an event every two to three weeks. Some events will be \u2018mix and mingles' with some kind of structured activity as its focal point. We will also be repeating our very popular Gallery Wine and Dessert events. Other events will have presentations given by inspiring leaders in the world of success building and I myself will give repeat presentations on my most popular topics from last year. Occasionally, we will also run our \u2018Speed Networking for Professionals\u2019 events as these highly structured gatherings can be VERY productive ways to make new connections\u2026when certain techniques are used to make them so. These techniques are shared at the events.\r\nFinally, we will continue to host our very popular ALWAYS Sold Out, 'Bagels and Business' morning events.\r\nCome out and join us at our next Connecting to Greatness event. We attract a wonderful and inspiring group of NYC area professionals. I look forward to meeting you!\r\n\u00a0\r\nWarm Regards,\r\n\u00a0\r\nKate Gaffin\r\n'Connecting to Greatness' - Inspired Business Networking\r\n                        \r\n

I\u2019m a lifelong entrepreneur and entrepreneurial energy is my absolute favorite kind. I created 'Connecting to Greatness' because I wanted to create a better, more rewarding and even fun networking experience. \u00a0And over the last couple of years, I've been invited to teach my style of Business Networking and 'Warm' Marketing to Diplomats at the British Consulate, Students and Alumni at Pace, Barnard and the Institute of Integrative Nutrition as well as to hundreds of Small Business Owners and Entrepreneurs in the NYC area.</SPAN></P>\r\n<P STYLE=\"margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; font-family: verdana, Arial, sans-serif; color: #555555; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;\">\u00a0</P>\r\n<P STYLE=\"margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; font-family: verdana, Arial, sans-serif; color: #555555; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;\"><STRONG STYLE=\"display: inline; font-family: inherit;\"><SPAN STYLE=\"font-family: inherit; color: #000080;\">To read a story on Fox News about my brand of Networking and Business Building, please click below:</SPAN></STRONG></P>\r\n<P STYLE=\"margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; font-family: verdana, Arial, sans-serif; color: #555555; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;\"><SPAN STYLE=\"font-family: inherit; color: #000080;\"><A STYLE=\"display: inline; font-family: inherit; cursor: pointer; color: #2a9bc7; text-decoration: none;\" HREF=\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2010/07/04/networking-heart/\" REL=\"nofollow\">http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2010/07/04/networking-heart/</A></SPAN></P>\r\n<P STYLE=\"margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; font-family: verdana, Arial, sans-serif; color: #555555; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;\"><SPAN STYLE=\"font-family: inherit; color: #000080;\">Connecting to Greatness is a different kind of networking group. Instead of simply throwing people into a room with no focus or no common goal, we strive to enlighten professionals on how to network more effectively and build their business more authentically. We want our attendees walking away from our gatherings with insight on what to do with all the business cards they\u2019ve collected and how to cultivate powerful alliances with those they meet. And we want to give our attendees the insights to grow the kind of business success they\u2019ve always dreamed of.</SPAN></P>\r\n<P STYLE=\"margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; font-family: verdana, Arial, sans-serif; color: #555555; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;\"><SPAN STYLE=\"font-family: inherit; color: #000080;\">In 2013, Connecting to Greatness will host an event every two to three weeks.

Other events will have presentations given by inspiring leaders in the world of success building and I myself will give repeat presentations on my most popular topics from last year. Occasionally, we will also run our \u2018Speed Networking for Professionals\u2019 events as these highly structured gatherings can be VERY productive ways to make new connections\u2026when certain techniques are used to make them so. These techniques are shared at the events.</SPAN></P>\r\n<P STYLE=\"margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; font-family: verdana, Arial, sans-serif; color: #555555; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;\"><STRONG STYLE=\"display: inline; font-family: inherit;\"><SPAN STYLE=\"font-family: inherit; color: #000080;\">Finally, we will continue to host our very popular ALWAYS Sold Out, 'Bagels and Business' morning events.</SPAN></STRONG></P>\r\n<P STYLE=\"margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; font-family: verdana, Arial, sans-serif; color: #555555; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;\"><SPAN STYLE=\"font-family: inherit; color: #000080;\">Come out and join us at our next Connecting to Greatness event.

I feel like hugging you through the computer.'\u00a0Sarah Bush/Sarah Bush Artwork/NY, NY\r\n~~~\r\nHi, I\u2019m Kate Gaffin. I\u2019m a lifelong entrepreneur and entrepreneurial energy is my absolute favorite kind.\r\nWhen I have a great idea, a great product, a great\u00a0\r\nservice\u2026I LOVE putting it out into the world. And I love taking people on a journey to saying \u2018Yes, I want that.\u2019\r\nSee when you have something of great value, something that can transform someone\u2019s life or business\u2026or maybe even just someone\u2019s moment and you offer it up with the highest integrity, respect and in many cases, even a sense of play, it is an incredibly honoring thing to do. It\u2019s also fun. And rewarding. It even gets people \u2018thanking you\u2019 for introducing it to them. And yes, it makes your bank account much fatter.\r\nOne of my first \u2018major\u2019 sales was to MTV. I created a gift item that I went on to patent and I thought they would be an ideal customer for it. People around me said, \u2018Oh, they\u2019ll never even take a meeting with you. If you do get a meeting, they\u2019ll never order anything. If they order anything, it\u2019ll be a bitch to get paid.\r\n\u00a0How did this all end up working out for me? I got the meeting with them after just one cold phone call. They placed an order two days after my first meeting. And, a check arrived two weeks after their order left my door.\r\nAfter this victory, I then went on to sell all kinds of products and services to organizations like The British Consulate, The National Army Guard, Nordstrom, AIG, High End Boutiques across the globe, Prestigious Art Museums and more. I secured a nice sized Angel Investment for one of my businesses and I\u2019ve sold products and services that didn\u2019t yet exist.\r\n\u00a0When people ask me how I even got into some of these enormous companies, I always say, \u2018It\u2019s really pretty easy. See, I never look at it as \u2018having to get into an enormous company.\u2019 I look at it as simply having to connect with one person within that company. Just one. And then that one person can open the doors to a whole world of possibilities.\u2019\r\n\u00a0What else?\u00a0\r\n\r\nI always make it about them.\r\nI am eternally curious.\r\nI never sell anything I am not in alignment with.\r\nI engage at the highest level with others.\r\nI never forget that we are all emotional beings at some level and that emotions play a HUGE role in what and how people buy.\r\n\r\nFinally, when Moxie is required, Moxie is put forth.\r\n\u00a0This is\u00a0\u2018Human To Human Selling\u2019\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0", "html": "<P STYLE=\"margin: 0px 0px 18px; padding: 0px; animation-duration: 0.1s; animation-name: fontfix; animation-iteration-count: 1; animation-timing-function: linear; animation-delay: 0.1s; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.670588); font-family: Whitney, helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22.4px;\">If you are interested in attending one of Kate's Highly Engaging, Spirited, Invaluable Entrepreneurial Skill Building webinars, have a look at what very recent attendees are saying:</P>\r\n<P STYLE=\"margin: 0px 0px 18px; padding: 0px; animation-duration: 0.1s; animation-name: fontfix; animation-iteration-count: 1; animation-timing-function: linear; animation-delay: 0.1s; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.670588); font-family: Whitney, helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22.4px;\"><SPAN STYLE=\"animation-duration: 0.1s; animation-name: fontfix; animation-iteration-count: 1; animation-timing-function: linear; animation-delay: 0.1s; font-size: medium;\"><SPAN STYLE=\"color: #1d2129; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; line-height: 17.94px; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><EM>'Thanks for such a unique and forward thinking webinar based on human values.

His goal is to portray atmosphere and emotion through his work, whether he is shooting locally in the midwest or traveling to epic locations around the world. Most recently Bryan's image of the 2017 solar eclipse received viral attention, as it offered up a totally unique perspective of such a highly documented event. Bryan is an Official Fujifilm X-Photographer and a Vangaurd Professional Ambassador.\n\nWhere do I go?\nGo to CameraMall\u00a0(518 E Washington St, Ann Arbor, MI 48104).

It took a lot of time and multiple detours along the way, but since 2015 Bryan has been pursuing landscape, lifestyle, and commercial photography as aggressively as one can while being a new father and still holding down a full-time job . His goal is to portray atmosphere and emotion through his work, whether he is shooting locally in the midwest or traveling to epic locations around the world. Most recently Bryan's image of the 2017 solar eclipse received viral attention, as it offered up a totally unique perspective of such a highly documented event. Bryan is an Official Fujifilm X-Photographer and a Vangaurd Professional Ambassador.</SPAN></P>\n<P><BR></P>\n<H2>Where do I go?</H2>\n<P><STRONG>Go to CameraMall</STRONG>\u00a0(518 E Washington St, Ann Arbor, MI 48104).

Should I still get my sensor cleaned?\n No. Even if your camera exterior is dirty, if there are no spots in your photos, there's no reason to get your sensor cleaned. Performing external cleaning of the camera or cleaning the mirror cage cavity can actually push dust onto your sensor, so if it's not broken, don't to try to fix it! ;) \n What is sensor cleaning?\n A certified repairman will use a combination of a sensor scope, a sensor vacuum, a hurricane blower, and sensor swabs to remove any dust or other foreign material that has settled on your sensor.  \n Why is it recommended a certified repairman performs the sensor cleaning? \nBecause the sensor is highly sensitive and easily scratched, we recommend leaving sensor cleaning to the professionals.  \n How much does it normally cost to have a sensor cleaned?\n Midwest Camera Repair, located in Wyandotte, MI typically charges $65 to perform sensor cleanings.\u00a0  This $30 sensor cleaning special we're offering runs one day only (Saturday, November 11th) and is a phenomenal deal!

From there, he took a Tech Rep position with Olympus Imaging in for the first stop in his career in the photo industry. Since then he has worked with such companies as Xrite, Ilford, Mamiya, Prophoto, and Sekonic. Marc continues to do freelance work as well and one of his clients is a major hospital system in NY city area. His work for them has included a variety of assignments for them\u2026from publicity portraits of patients and corporate events.

It's one of the world's first mirrorless medium-format cameras. Join Fujifilm X Delegate, Bryan Minear, as he discusses why a photographer would choose a medium format camera and why this particular camera was revolutionary in the photo industry. Is the GFX for you?\nRather have some hands-on time with the camera? No problem--we'll have a GFX 50s for you to try as well!\n\nThe Photographer\n\nBryan Minear, a Fujifilm X-Series Photographer and Delegate. \nBryan is an Ohio\u00adborn photographer and graphic designer currently based in the Midwest. His passion for design and photography started at a young age, but it wasn\u2019t until he took his first film photography class in college that he began to recognize it as a form of art and expression. He established his own freelance creative company while still in school and immediately got to work.

His passion for design and photography started at a young age, but it wasn\u2019t until he took his first film photography class in college that he began to recognize it as a form of art and expression. He established his own freelance creative company while still in school and immediately got to work. From weddings and commercial work to his true passion landscape and cityscape photography, Bryan has been a part of the industry for over 10 years and is only just getting started traveling and teaching workshops. Since picking up the original X100 in 2011, Fujifilm X Series cameras have transformed his style and technique, and have since become his gear of choice for all aspects of his work.

Between then and the 1980s, most FinTech advancements were record-keeping and data systems found in the back offices of financial institutions, out of sight of the public. As internet technology became more available, however, FinTech evolved rapidly. Financial firms digitized their processes, and companies began introducing consumer-facing products such as online banking and PayPal.
