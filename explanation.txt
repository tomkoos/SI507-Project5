I am accessing the Eventbrite search API and gathering:
- All *free* and *paid* events, start within this month, still active, and are located within 1 mile from Ann Arbor
- For each event, I'll be accessing the event's name, category, start and end date, description, organizer, venue name and address, and url
- I'll write 2 CSV files, one for free events, another for paid events
- Data in each CSV file: 4 columns -- text, number hashtags, time posted, user who posted the tweet
- URL for the API: <URL HERE>
- If necessary, URL describing the authentication process for the API: <URL HERE>
