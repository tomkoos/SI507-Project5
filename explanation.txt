I am accessing the Eventbrite search API and gathering:
- All free and paid events, start within November, that are still active, and are located within 1 mile from Ann Arbor
- For each event, I'll be accessing the event's name, category, start and end date, description, organizer, venue name and address, and url
- I'll write 2 CSV files, one for list of free events, another for list of paid events
- Data in each CSV file: 9 columns -- name of the event, category, start date (local), end date	(local), description, organizer, venue name, venue address, and the URL for this event
- Both CSV files' data are sorted by start date
- URL for the API: https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/events/search/
- URL describing the authentication process for the API: https://www.eventbrite.com/developer/v3/quickstart/
