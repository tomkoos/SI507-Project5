Teacher: Beth Battey

Churchmouse’s pretty “Flowers Scarf” will keep summer in bloom around your neck all winter! Choose yarn that plays with color (like Zauberball or Crazy Zauberball) for a cheerful accessory, or go with a hand-dyed tonal skein for a more delicate bouquet. You’ll be making the smaller size of the two scarves detailed in Churchmouse’s pattern (plenty big for wearing around your neck), but once you get the hang of joining the flower motifs, you’ll easily be able to create larger pieces. Beth will show you how to create and join your motifs during week 1’s longer session, setting you up to work successfully at home before you return for questions and follow-up during week 2’s shorter session. It’s past time for you to make yourself something special! 
Pre-requisites: Participants should be familiar with the following: chain stitch, single crochet, double crochet, half double crochet, slip stitch.
Materials: 
• One skein (440 yds.) of fingering weight yarn, purchased from Spun
• Size US E crochet hook
• Darning or tapestry needle (optional)
• Pattern provided by Spun

What is the buyer interested in?
 The used camera buyer told us he's interested in collectible or current lenses and interchangeable lens cameras in clean and working condition.

Attendees will be served in a first come, first served fashion--the buyer will call each sequential ticket number in order. We will do our best to estimate wait-times--early indicators are that there is a high-degree of interest, which may result in a considerable wait time. You are welcome to leave the store or participate in many of our free educational events of the day, and we will contact you when it is near your turn.
Is there a way to expedite the buying of my gear?
We have made arrangements for an expedited process for lower-value transactions.

Please ask a staff member when you arrive if you think you may be selling an item that fits this category.

The Photographer

Bryan Minear, a Fujifilm X-Series Photographer and Delegate. 
Bryan Minear is a midwest-based designer, photographer, father, and pizza connosieur. From a young age Bryan was inspired by Ansel Adams' ethereal landscape work, which paved the direction he wanted to go as an artist. It took a lot of time and multiple detours along the way, but since 2015 Bryan has been pursuing landscape, lifestyle, and commercial photography as aggressively as one can while being a new father and still holding down a full-time job . His goal is to portray atmosphere and emotion through his work, whether he is shooting locally in the midwest or traveling to epic locations around the world. Most recently Bryan's image of the 2017 solar eclipse received viral attention, as it offered up a totally unique perspective of such a highly documented event. Bryan is an Official Fujifilm X-Photographer and a Vangaurd Professional Ambassador.

Where do I go?
Go to CameraMall (518 E Washington St, Ann Arbor, MI 48104). After confirming you're registered to attend, we'll escort you to The Michigan Theater Screening Room--we have a backdoor entrance right behind our store. The class will be held in The Michigan Theater Screening Room.

How long will it take to have my sensor cleaned?
Anticipate anywhere from 15 minutes to a few hours to have your sensor cleaned at the event. We'll text you as soon as the cleaning is completed. From our experience with previous events like this, we anticipate a high-volume of cleanings, which could cause a few hour wait.

Midwest Camera Repair will stop accepting sensor cleanings after 3:30PM, so please make sure you arrive before 3:30PM if you want your camera's sensor cleaned.
Can I drop off my camera in advance to have the sensor cleaned at the $30 event special price?
Yes, you can drop off your camera prior to the event if you can't make it to the event, and you'll receive the $30 sensor cleaning price. However, Midwest Camera Repair will be prioritizing sensor cleanings for customers who attend the event on Saturday, November 11th. If you choose to drop off your camera prior to the event for sensor cleaning, it won't be ready for pick-up until Wednesday, November 15th during our normal business hours.


Frequently Asked Questions about Sensor Cleaning 
 Why do I need my sensor cleaned?
 Dust can accumulate on the part of the camera that takes the picture (the sensor), which plague your photos with black dots that appear in the same spot on every photo.
 The outside of my camera is dirty/dusty, but I don't see spots in my photos. Should I still get my sensor cleaned?
 No. Even if your camera exterior is dirty, if there are no spots in your photos, there's no reason to get your sensor cleaned. Performing external cleaning of the camera or cleaning the mirror cage cavity can actually push dust onto your sensor, so if it's not broken, don't to try to fix it! ;) 
 What is sensor cleaning?
 A certified repairman will use a combination of a sensor scope, a sensor vacuum, a hurricane blower, and sensor swabs to remove any dust or other foreign material that has settled on your sensor.  
 Why is it recommended a certified repairman performs the sensor cleaning? 
Because the sensor is highly sensitive and easily scratched, we recommend leaving sensor cleaning to the professionals.  
 How much does it normally cost to have a sensor cleaned?
 Midwest Camera Repair, located in Wyandotte, MI typically charges $65 to perform sensor cleanings.   This $30 sensor cleaning special we're offering runs one day only (Saturday, November 11th) and is a phenomenal deal!

The Photographer

Marc Farb is a technical representative for Sigma. For Marc, photography is more than just a job, or a way to earn a steady income, it’s a way of life. Even more, it’s the chance to capture special moments in time and show them off to the world in a way they may never get to see them. It’s his job to preserve a moment in time and evoke a reaction from people who view his images.
Marc’s father was a Type Setter in the printing industry way back at the cross over point from lead type to negative film. So there was never a shortage of film in the house. He was given his first camera at the age of 8 years old and by the time he was 14 he had his own darkroom.
He attended the College of Boca Raton in the mid 80’s where he studied Electrical engineering as a major with a minor in computer science. Being that the school was only a few miles from an IBM facility, most of his professors were also involved in projects that would later impact the photo industry in major ways.
Fast forward 25 years, and Marc eventually became a freelance commercial photographer. From there, he took a Tech Rep position with Olympus Imaging in for the first stop in his career in the photo industry. Since then he has worked with such companies as Xrite, Ilford, Mamiya, Prophoto, and Sekonic. Marc continues to do freelance work as well and one of his clients is a major hospital system in NY city area. His work for them has included a variety of assignments for them…from publicity portraits of patients and corporate events. He is also experienced in medical and surgical photography.
Currently Marc’s assignment includes technical application support from the corporate office, as well as extensive traveling for photo conventions and trade shows for Sigma. He is proficient in Photoshop and Lightroom on a PC and Mac.
His experiences over the years have allowed him to teach classes all around the US and Canada on photographic topics that range from pixel to print, and all points between.
Marc lives on Long Island with his wife and two lovely daughters.

The Photographer

Bryan Minear, a Fujifilm X-Series Photographer and Delegate. 
Bryan is an Ohio­born photographer and graphic designer currently based in the Midwest. His passion for design and photography started at a young age, but it wasn’t until he took his first film photography class in college that he began to recognize it as a form of art and expression. He established his own freelance creative company while still in school and immediately got to work. From weddings and commercial work to his true passion landscape and cityscape photography, Bryan has been a part of the industry for over 10 years and is only just getting started traveling and teaching workshops. Since picking up the original X100 in 2011, Fujifilm X Series cameras have transformed his style and technique, and have since become his gear of choice for all aspects of his work.

FinTech Risks & Opportunities: An Interdisciplinary Approach,Other,2017-11-16 08:00:00,2017-11-17 17:00:00,"Third Annual Financial Stability ConferenceHosted by the Office of Financial Research and the Center on Finance, Law, and Policy at University of MichiganThursday-Friday, November 16-17, 2017 @ University of Michigan Law School
Keynotes by Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard and Financial Times' US Managing Editor Gillian Tett
This two-day event will bring together a wide range of researchers, policymakers, students, and practitioners from various disciplines.
Financial technology, or FinTech, can be traced back to the introduction of the telegraph in the 1860s. Between then and the 1980s, most FinTech advancements were record-keeping and data systems found in the back offices of financial institutions, out of sight of the public. As internet technology became more available, however, FinTech evolved rapidly. Financial firms digitized their processes, and companies began introducing consumer-facing products such as online banking and PayPal. Today, FinTech continues to disrupt and to evolve, not only in how financial products and services are delivered, but who delivers them. Regulators and market participants face challenges in understanding and balancing the benefits of FinTech against potential risks.
Innovation helps catalyze growth and new opportunities while generating new risks. Regulatory structures in place could fail to accommodate changes in the financial marketplace. Regulators may overreact to new technologies, stifling innovation and locking in old forms of doing business. At the same time, regulatory complacency can have disastrous results, permitting the buildup of systemic risk or widespread consumer harms. This conference will explore methodologies that the private sector, researchers, and policymakers can use harness the upside potential of financial innovation while reducing the downside risks.
Panel topics will include:

The contours of entity-based regulation of innovation: FinTech charters and regulatory boundaries
FinTech innovations and the economy: High-Frequency Trading, Robo-Advising, and Artificial Intelligence
Systemic Risk in the Infrastructure: FinTech Problems and Solutions
FinTech and Financial Inclusion
RegTech: How Can Regulators be Part of the Solution?
Innovation & Regulation: Tradeoffs and Paths Forward

Churchmouse’s pretty “Flowers Scarf” will keep summer in bloom around your neck all winter! Choose yarn that plays with color (like Zauberball or Crazy Zauberball) for a cheerful accessory, or go with a hand-dyed tonal skein for a more delicate bouquet. You’ll be making the smaller size of the two scarves detailed in Churchmouse’s pattern (plenty big for wearing around your neck), but once you get the hang of joining the flower motifs, you’ll easily be able to create larger pieces. Beth will show you how to create and join your motifs during week 1’s longer session, setting you up to work successfully at home before you return for questions and follow-up during week 2’s shorter session. It’s past time for you to make yourself something special! 
Pre-requisites: Participants should be familiar with the following: chain stitch, single crochet, double crochet, half double crochet, slip stitch.
Materials: 
• One skein (440 yds.) of fingering weight yarn, purchased from Spun

Conway's GoL has four simple rules, but the result of those rules can appear fascinatingly complex. There are lots of online resources that are only a search away, but Wikipedia's entry and ConwayLife.com's Wiki are both good places to start; if you're more of a video person, check out AlexFSmirnov's 2 min intro to GoL.If Cellular Automata fascinate you, you likely will enjoy ""Golly"", an Open Source app that will get you seriously hooked on the power of ""four simple rules"".

Ford Auditorium | University of Michigan, Ann Arbor3:00-5:30 PMLive webcast available
This year’s symposium will focus on how challenges associated with managing acute and chronic pain have led to an explosion in the abuse of prescription pain medications and a nationwide epidemic. Panelists will consider how to inform health care policies that impact the opioid epidemic by asking:  


How can we use the wealth of epidemiological, clinical, and basic science information about the biology of pain and addiction to stem the opioid epidemic?


What can be done now?


What should be done in the longer term?



Pioneering pain researcher, Dr. Allan Basbaum, Professor and Chair of the Department of Anatomy at the University of California, San Francisco, and member of the National Academy of Medicine, will describe the current understanding of the neurobiology of pain and discuss opportunities to translate knowledge about basic research into treatments for various types of pain, as the country continues to confront real life challenges.
 The plenary lecture will be followed by a panel of University of Michigan faculty who will address various facets of the opioid epidemic across a wide range of disciplines; including:

Epidemiological aspects of opioid use and abuse
Clinical aspects of acute and chronic pain treatment
Neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms that predispose to substance use and addiction, and
Molecular and pharmacological aspects of opioid actions

A closing reception for all guests will follow the symposium.
